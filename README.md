> :fuelpump: Self-hosted [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) ftw!

shunction (SHell Function) is a parody of _Azure Functions_. When I first heard of Azure Functions, I knew I had to write this.

In short, _shunction_ given a folder of function scripts, provides various mechanisms by which they can be triggered.

## Getting Started
Simply clone this repository like this:

```bash
git clone git@
cd shunction;
```
